# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my personal Linux dotfiles.

- Configs that reside in `~/.config` are found in `config`.
- Configs that reside in `~/.local/share` are found in `share`.
- Configs that reside in `~/` are found in the root of the repository.
- Scripts are found in `scripts`

## Notes

1. **These dotfiles work for me, and are not guaranteed to work for other people. Make sure to check the code before using them!**
2. Many configs include stuff that I've found from all over the internet. I've tried to give credit where credit is due, but I might have missed someone. Sorry!
