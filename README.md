<h1 align="center">~/.files</h1>

This is a collection of my personal Linux dotfiles. Have a look around and hopefully you'll find something useful :)

Most notably, you'll find my configs for:

+ [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
+ tmux
+ zsh
+ [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot)

Here is a sneak-peak on how everything looks:

## Requirements

+ For icons to be displayed correctly, you need to use a [nerd-font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
+ For [nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) to automatically install LSP servers, `npm` must be in your `$PATH`.
+ Tools like `prettier`, `yamllint`, `stylua`, `black`, and `isort` must be in your `$PATH` for code formatting to work.
+ Probably something else that I'm forgetting..

## Notes

1. **These dotfiles work for me, and are not guaranteed to work for other people. Make sure to check the code before using them!**
2. Many configs include stuff that I've found from all over the internet. I've tried to give credit where credit is due, but I might have missed someone. Sorry!
