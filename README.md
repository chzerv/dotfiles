# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my personal Linux dotfiles. Have a look around and hopefully you'll find something useful :)

Most notably, you'll find my configs for:

+ [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
+ tmux
+ zsh
+ The [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) terminal emulator

## Notes

1. **These dotfiles work for me, and are not guaranteed to work for other people. Make sure to check the code before using them!**
2. Many configs include stuff that I've found from all over the internet. I've tried to give credit where credit is due, but I might have missed someone. Sorry!
