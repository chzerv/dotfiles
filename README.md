<h1 align="center">~/.files</h1>

This is a collection of my personal Linux dotfiles. Have a look around and hopefully you'll find something useful :)

## Requirements

+ Neovim HEAD
+ Sway HEAD
+ `npm` and `go` must be in your `$PATH` so that LSP servers can be automatically installed
+ `prettier`, `yamllint`, `stylua`, `black`, and `rustfmt` and `gofmt`must be in your `$PATH` for code formatting to work
+ Probably something else that I'm forgetting..

## Notes

1. **These dotfiles work for me, and are not guaranteed to work for other people. Make sure to check the code before using them!**
2. Many configs include stuff that I've found from all over the internet. I've tried to give credit where credit is due, but I might have missed someone. Sorry!
