<h1 align="center">~/.files</h1>

This is a collection of my personal Linux dotfiles. Have a look around and hopefully you'll find something useful :)

## Requirements

+ For icons to be displayed correctly, a [nerd-font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) must be used
+ (nvim) For [nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) to automatically install LSP servers, `npm` and `go` must be in your `$PATH`
+ (nvim) `prettier`, `yamllint`, `stylua`, `black`, `isort` and `gofmt` must be in your `$PATH` for code formatting to work
+ (nvim) LSP servers for [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-language-server) and [Bash](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server) must be installed manually
+ Probably something else that I'm forgetting..

## Notes

1. **These dotfiles work for me, and are not guaranteed to work for other people. Make sure to check the code before using them!**
2. Many configs include stuff that I've found from all over the internet. I've tried to give credit where credit is due, but I might have missed someone. Sorry!
